Real-Time Object Detection (YOLOv5)

A simple demo using **YOLOv5** and a webcam to detect and label objects in real time.

# Run the script
```bash
python object_detection_webcam.py
```

Press q to quit.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV

## Next Steps
 - Add face detection as a second project.
 - Explore object tracking for moving targets.
 - Integrate with robot/drone navigation systems.
